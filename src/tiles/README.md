# Contributing a tile

This is mostly going in order of https://web.archive.org/web/20150114223349/http://www.alexa.com/topsites, so look at the commit history and add whatever site comes next after the most recently added one in the above list. See `template.psd` for some cues on size and position in the tile.

- Images must be an official logo for the site (no user-generated logos, images with other art, etc.)
- Size: `800x500` pixels (`16:10` aspect ratio)
- Must be in png format.

Please name the tile using the format `domain.tld.png`. For example, the tile for `http://example.com` would be `example.com.png`.
